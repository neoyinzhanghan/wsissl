## A SSL Training Package for Whole Slide Images (WSI)

`Package Philosophy:` 

Whenever possible, we just use other people's packages to run the training of an SSL architecture. This package mainly serves as the connective tissue between various existing SSL training workhorses with WSI datasets. This package serves as a temporary, in-development adjunct tool to packages such as `yatt`, `yaimpl`, and `wsip`.

`General Structure:`

For each SSL architecture supported by `wsissl`, this package provides instructions and code for their proper installation, data preparation, training, and deployment for applications to WSI datasets.
